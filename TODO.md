- Write cpp tests to speed up development
- Manage treatment ID mapping in C++ to elide expensive Polars explode step
- Make pyarrow -> C++ vector conversion truly zero-copy
- Move from Cython to [nanobind](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/)
  - Allows us to minimise translation layer (no more Cython data processing)
  - Faster compilation
- Support both numpy and arrow inputs
  - [numpy CAN be zero-copy](https://docs.pola.rs/py-polars/html/reference/dataframe/api/polars.DataFrame.to_numpy.html)
- Support both int and str treatment/patient IDs (allows zero-copy Polars->numpy conversion)
- Patient treatment sets are not contiguous across patients, leads to cache misses in convex_hull.hpp. Replace `vector<vector<TreatmentView>>` with flattened array
